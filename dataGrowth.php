  <p class="mt-6 mb-6 ml-6">One of the most pressing Big Data challenges is storage.
    Data is growing exponentially with time, and with that,
    enterprises are struggling to store these huge sets of
    data. Much of this data is extracted from images, audio,
    documents, text files, etc. that are unstructured and not in
    databases. It is difficult to extract and analyze such
    unstructured data. These issues are a part of the Big Data
    infrastructure challenges.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p class="mt-6 mb-6 ml-6">Dealing with rapid data growth can be facilitated through
    converged and hyper-converged infrastructure and
    software-defined storage. Additionally, compression,
    tiering, and deduplication can reduce space consumption,
    as well as cut costs on storage. Enterprises also use
    tools such as Big Data Analytics software, Hadoop,
    NoSQL database, Spark, AI, Machine Learning, BI
    applications, etc. to deal with this issue.
